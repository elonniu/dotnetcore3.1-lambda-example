## .NET Core 3.1 Lambda example

# Requirements

For viewing lambda function log, you'll need `jq` and `base64` libraries
installed (or you can view logs in CloudWatch logs)

# Quick Start

To quickly test application build, deployment and run, use `test.sh`
script from top-level directory, it's assuming that you have bash shell
installed

```
$ ./test.sh

```
